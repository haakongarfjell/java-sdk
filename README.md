# Java Vipps SDK

### Prerequisites

Only Java 17 has been tested for building the project.
Enable Gradle and Lombok support in your IDE.

### Building

The language level of the project is Java 8. The project uses Gradle as a build tool.
To build the project, run ./gradlew build, or use the Gradle wrapper in your IDE.

### Formatting

The project uses Google's Java code style with Spotless.

### Models

Autogenerated models were used as a base. They were then manually edited to fit the specifications of the Vipps APIs.
To generate new models, run the generateSwaggerCode and postProcessSwaggerCode Gradle tasks.
This shouldn't be done unless the API specs get a new major version, and the generated model will require manual cleanup
depending on the specification.
For minor/patch versions, the models should be manually edited.

### Licensing
Run the licenseReport task to generate a report of the dependencies and their licenses.
