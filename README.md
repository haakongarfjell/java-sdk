# Java Vipps SDK

### Models
Autogenerated models were used as a base. They were then manually edited to fit the specifications of the Vipps APIs.
To generate new models, run the generateSwaggerCode and postProcessSwaggerCode Gradle tasks.
This shouldn't be done unless the API specs get a new major version, and the generated model will require manual cleanup depending on the specification.
For minor/patch versions, the models should be manually edited.
